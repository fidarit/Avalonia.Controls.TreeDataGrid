## Introduction

`TreeDataGrid` is a control for the [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) UI framework which displays hierarchical and tabular data together in a single view. It is a combination of a `TreeView` and `DataGrid` control.

The control has two modes of operation:

- Hierarchical: data is displayed in a tree with optional columns
- Flat: data is displayed in a 2D table, similar to other `DataGrid` controls

An example of `TreeDataGrid` displaying hierarchical data:

An example of `TreeDataGrid` displaying flat data:
